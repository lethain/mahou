You should have Google App Engine (GAE) already installed and configured
Save the qa.zip file in your gae directory (or wherever)
Unzip it, cd into the qa directory

In the config file supply your BOSS appid
In the app.yaml file change the application name to your Google App Engine name

Then you're done

Should be able to cd out one level and run

appcfg.py update qa/

to upload the project to GAE
